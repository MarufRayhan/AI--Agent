The Mobile Delivery Application is a tool that helps postal workers to prepare, deliver, and account for their deliveries. It has three main phases: Preparation, Delivery, and Accounting.
- In the Preparation phase, the user logs in by scanning their user barcode and adding their tour or delivery area number. The user also tags their card to the device. The user then goes to the Preparation menu and scans the items to be delivered. The items are displayed in a list with different colors according to their type and delivery option. The user can also see the additional information for each item, such as the delivery address, the recipient name, and the special labels that indicate the delivery conditions. The user can also use the quick links to perform different actions on the items, such as:
  Removing: The user can delete an item from the list if it is not needed or not available.
  Status: The user can assign a delivery obstacle status to an item, such as “Company closed” or “Refused to accept”. The item is then removed from the list and the status is shown in the back-end.
  Moving: The user can move an item to another list, such as a new or existing STOP list or a GAS list. A STOP list is a list of items that are delivered at the same stop, such as a building or a street. A GAS list is a list of items that are delivered to a GAS customer, such as a supermarket or a pharmacy. The user can also set the number of print copies for each list.
  GAS: The user can create a GAS list and scan the items that belong to it. The user can also choose a GAS customer from a list of predefined options.
